Introduction to NumPy (Python) 
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a core Python library used for numerical computing, 
especially in Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, and scientific computing.

What is NumPy?

NumPy provides:
1.A powerful N-dimensional array object (ndarray)
2.Fast mathematical and statistical operations
3.Tools for linear algebra, random numbers, and Fourier transforms


Why NumPy is Important?

1.⚡ Very fast (written in C internally)
2.📉 Uses less memory than Python lists
3.🧠 Foundation for Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
